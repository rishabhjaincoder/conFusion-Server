first we have installed the express generator using 
	npm install -g express-generator
	here -g means we are installing this globally

then we created a express project using express generator like this
	express conFusionServer // this will create a express project 
	cd <in this directory>
	npm install // this will install all the modules required and mentioned in the package.json file
